You will be given lists of country names and their corresponding incarceration rates (number of people incarcerated per 100,000 people). Your task is to write a function to compute the standard deviation, then identify and print a list of countries with incarceration rates at least two standard deviations above the mean.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","\n","1. You will be provided with two lists: `countries` (containing country names) and `incarceration_rates` (containing the corresponding incarceration rates). There is **no need to re-write** these lines: assume that the following lines are at the top of the program:\n","\n","\n","```\n","countries = [\"China\", \"Mexico\", \"Italy\", \"India\", \"Ghana\", \"Brazil\", \"South Africa\",\n","              \"Japan\", \"Iran\", \"Russia\", \"New Zealand\", \"United States\"]\n","\n","incarceration_rates = [121, 166, 89, 35, 42, 357, 248, 38, 228, 329, 188, 664]\n","```\n","\n","\n","2. **Define a function** called `compute_std` that takes one parameter, `data`, which is the list of values to compute the standard deviation of.\n","\n","3. Inside the function, **calculate the mean** of the values in the list, `data`, and store this value in a variable called `mean_rate`.\n","\n","4. Next, **create an empty list** in a new variable called `distances`. This list will eventually hold the distance of each country's incarceration rate from the mean.\n","\n","5. **Write a for loop** to iterate through each value in the list `data`. Inside the loop, calculate the distance of the value from the mean, and append it to the `distances` list.\n","\n","- *Hint: Recall that the distance from the mean will be a positive value regardless of whether it is above or below the mean. Therefore, we can use the built-in **abs()** function to get the absolute value of the difference between each rate and the mean.*\n","\n","6. After the loop, **return the standard deviation**. Since the standard deviation is the average distance from the mean, calculate this value by finding the average of the `distances` list.\n","\n","7. **Call your function**, passing the `incarceration_rates` list as the argument for `data`, and store the result in a new variable called `std_rate`.\n","\n","8. **Print the resulting standard deviation** with an appropriate message.\n","\n","9. **Write a for loop using range** to print the names of the countries whose incarceration rates are at least 2 standard deviations above the mean (Note: this will require using a conditional statement inside of the for loop)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dzZZJyuRDTPN"},"source":["# **Problem 2**: Individual Portion"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1MB-uQgtDjQN"},"source":["Think of your own example of something that could be translated into a Python program.
