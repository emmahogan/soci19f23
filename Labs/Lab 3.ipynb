Before analyzing the data, the researcher wants to remove all of the data entries that are negative numbers, as this is not possible and therefore a mistake. In data analysis, we would call this part of the \"Data Cleaning\" or \"Data Verification\" process, for which Python is a powerful tool.\n","\n","Rather than go through her data manually to remove these invalid entries, she has hired you as an intern to write a Python program.\n","\n","**Objective:**\n","In this lab, students will write a Python program to clean a dataset containing participants' sleep duration data. The goal is to remove any negative entries before further analysis.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","\n","1. **Data Cleaning Function:**\n","   - Write a Python function called `clean_sleep_data` that takes one parameter:\n","     - `sleep_data`: a list of numerical data representing the hours of sleep each participant got.\n","\n","   - Inside the function, create a new empty list called `cleaned_data`. This will eventually hold all of the non-negative numbers that we want to keep.\n","\n","   - Use a for loop to iterate through each entry in the `sleep_data` list.\n","   \n","   - For each entry, check if it's a positive number. If it is, append it to the `cleaned_data` list. (Discuss with your group: should 0 be included? Write your boolean expression accordingly)\n","\n","   - Return the `cleaned_data` list.\n","\n","2. **Testing:**\n","   - Outside of the function, create a sample dataset (a list) with both positive and negative sleep duration values, including some invalid entries.\n","\n","   - Call the `clean_sleep_data` function with the sample dataset and store the result in a variable.\n","\n","   - Print the cleaned dataset.\n","\n","**Example Test Case:**\n","\n","```python\n","# Sample dataset\n","sample_data = [7, 8, -6, 5, -3, 9, -2, 6]\n","\n","# Expected Output:\n","Cleaned Data: [7, 8, 5, 9, 6]\n","```\n","\n","3. **Optional Challenges:**\n","   - Print a message each time a negative number is found including the number and a message indicating that it's an invalid entry and is not included in the cleaned data.\n","\n","   - Have your function print a message stating how many invalid numbers were removed total before returning the cleaned data (Note: this will involve figuring out a way to keep track of or compute this number). There are several ways to do this!"],"metadata":{"id":"l3n8id5WnMqe"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"V0xMOI67FfkD"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]}]}
