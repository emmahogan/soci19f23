This exercise will help you practice defining functions and using conditionals.\n","\n","### **Instructions:**\n","1. Write a Python function called `magic_8_ball` that takes one parameter:\n","    - `question`: a string representing the user's question.\n","\n","2. Inside the function, determine the length of the user's question using the len() function, and store this value in a variable.\n","\n","3. Use conditional statements to select a response based on the length of the question:\n","\n","    - If the question is shorter than 10 characters, the response should be \"Signs point to yes\"\n","    - If the question is 10 characters or longer but shorter than 20 characters, the response should be \"Ask again later\"\n","    - If the question is 20 characters or longer, the response should be \"Don't count on it\"\n","\n","4. Return the selected response.\n","\n","5. Back outside of the function, prompt the user to enter a yes-or-no question.\n","\n","6. Call the `magic_8_ball` function with the user's question as the argument.\n","\n","7. Display the Magic 8-Ball's response to the user.\n","\n","8. **Optional Challenge:** Use recursion to ask the user \"Would you like to ask another question?\" after each answer, and keep going until they respond \"No\"."],"metadata":{"id":"l3n8id5WnMqe"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"V0xMOI67FfkD"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Section 2: Stack Diagrams**\n","###Activity 2.1: List the first 8 instructions to execute in the **order of execution** for the program above.
